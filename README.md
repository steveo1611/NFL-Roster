# NFL_Roster

Fantasy Hand-Egg!!! OK, Football. In case you have never participated in a fantasy football league here is a basic overview from NFL.com:

`Fantasy football, like other fantasy games, puts you in the front office and on the sidelines as General Manager and Coach of your team. You select from a list of the best players in the NFL and they compete on a weekly basis for your team.`

For this project we will be creating a dynamic roster that allows users to add and remove players to a team as well as search all the NFL filtering the results by player name, team, or position.
